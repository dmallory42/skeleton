# Slim Framework 3 Skeleton Application

Use this skeleton application to quickly setup and start working on a new Slim Framework 3 application. This application uses the latest Slim 3 with the PHP-View template renderer. It also uses the Monolog logger.

This skeleton application was built for Composer. This makes setting up a new Slim Framework application quick and easy.

## Install the Application

This can simply be checked out using the command `git clone https://github.com/dmallory42/skeleton.git [my-project-name]` to clone it from GitHub into a new directory, then customised for usage to build your project.

That's it! Now go build something cool.
